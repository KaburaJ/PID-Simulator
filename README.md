# PID Simulator Application

This repository contains a control-based simulation application that aims at exploring the intricacies of PID control. Given the proportional and Derivative values, the application can simulate the value itself on one graph as well as the expected line following robot movement on another. Though not fully accurate, it is my version one of something I have wanted to implement ever since I interacted with line following robots. I hope to broaden it to accomodate the Integral input value in future but currently, I am focusing on the `P` and `D` values alone.

The application can be accessed [here](https://kaburaj.github.io/PID-Simulator/)
